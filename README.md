# Altoonocam
Cameras no longer work due to a change in the [511Pa API](https://www.witf.org/2024/06/04/511-pennsylvania-the-statewide-travel-information-system-gets-major-update/). <br> <br>
I will not be updating this website further due to this change.\
While I most likely could update the website to account for this, there is a lack of passion at the moment for such a project.\
If you need to access Traffic Cameras in Altoona PA you can do so via the following updated URL;\
[https://www.511pa.com/cctv](https://www.511pa.com/cctv?length=100&filters%5B0%5D%5Bi%5D=2&filters%5B0%5D%5Bs%5D=Altoona%2FSouthern+Alleghenies) <br> <br>
I have no plans to update this website further and as such it will be archived.\
If you want to make your own website, camera feeds are streamed from 511pa using m3u8 HLS and need something to blob like [https://livepush.io](https://livepush.io/hls-player/index.html) for example.\
The website itself is very good now, so I have less of a reason to host something like this.
